## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### I am Reto Froelicher. After years of self-employment, I have decided to pass on my knowledge to young people and give them the tools they need on their journey.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on learning content in various programming languages
- ðŸŒ± I deepen my knowledge in various programming languages such as PHP, Node.js, React, React native, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, Python and everything's interessting
- ðŸ‘¯ I want to empower young people to become programmers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you like
- âš¡ Fun fact: To balance out the programming, I am an active paraglider pilot and let my thoughts run free while flying.
