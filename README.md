## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

#I am Reto Froelicher. After years of self-employment, I have decided to pass on my knowledge to young people and give them the tools they need on their journey.

- ðŸ”­ I am currently working on learning content in various programming languages
- ðŸŒ± I deepen my knowledge in various programming languages such as PHP, Node.js, React, React native, Ruby, Java, Kotlin & Python
- ðŸ‘¯ I want to empower young people to become programmers
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything you like
- âš¡ Fun fact: In addition to programming, I am an active paraglider pilot and ventilate my head while flying.
